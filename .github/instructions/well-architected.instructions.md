# Well-Architected reference

For any non-trivial design choice, consult the local WAF reference in
[docs/waf/](../../docs/waf/) and **cite the pillar(s)** you are optimizing for
and what you trade away (see the base operating model in
`copilot-instructions.md`).

- Pillar checklists and trade-off prompts live in `docs/waf/`.
- These are version-controlled, reviewable references — prefer them (and live
  doc MCP servers) over model memory.
- When a decision is made, record the rationale in the relevant `specs/<slug>/spec.md`.
